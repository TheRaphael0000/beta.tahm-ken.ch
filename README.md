# beta.tahm-ken.ch

The maybe futur tahm-ken.ch website.

I'm leaning Svelte.

I want to create a headless version of Tahm-ken.ch. I will still need a backend at some point. I'll recycle the current website to create the API.

For now I only do what I can on the client side.

## Dev

```bash
npm i # install dependencies
npm run dev # run dev env
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build # build
npm run preview # test the build
```
